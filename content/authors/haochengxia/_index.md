Haocheng Xia is a first-year Ph.D. student in the Data and Information Systems Laboratory (DAIS) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), with a keen interest in machine learning and storage systems. As a Summer of Reproducibility (SoR) 2025 contributor, Haocheng is enhancing the CacheBench project. His work focuses on building a comprehensive benchmark suite for cache eviction algorithms, providing researchers with an effortless way to compare their designs against existing solutions, analyze performance across diverse microbenchmarks and workloads, and participate in an open cache competition leaderboard. He has previously contributed to libCacheSim, a high-performance simulation tool critical to CacheBench, and is committed to maintaining the benchmark beyond the SoR program.
