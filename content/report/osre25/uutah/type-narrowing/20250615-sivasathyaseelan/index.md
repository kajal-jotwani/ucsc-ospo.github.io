Hello! I’m Siva Sathyaseelan D N, a pre-final year B.Tech + M.Tech Engineering student at IIT BHU, Varanasi, India. With a deep-rooted passion for software development and scientific computing. I thrive at the intersection of code and real-world problem-solving. For two years, I’ve engaged in open-source work across scientific simulation, blockchain, and cloud-native technologies, through hobby projects, hackathons, internships, and an LFX mentee. I will be working on [Type Narrowing: Evaluate New Gradual Languages and Do Unsound Narrowings Lead to Exploits](/project/osre25/uutah/type-narrowing/) under the mentorship of [Ben Greenman](/content/authors/bennn).
