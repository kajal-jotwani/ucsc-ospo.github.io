Hi! I'm Hanzhong Liu, a Computer Science student at Fordham University with a minor in Business Administration. My interests lie in distributed systems, backend engineering, and decentralized tools—especially systems that prioritize user autonomy and privacy.

This summer, I'm contributing to the [Peersky](https://github.com/p2plabsxyz/peersky-browser) project as part of OSRE 2025 through Google Summer of Code. My project, **"Implement Web Extensions & System Settings Integration,"** will add full support for local browser extensions in Peersky, allowing users to customize their experience without relying on centralized extension stores.

Deliverables include an extension loader, drag-and-drop installation for `.zip` and Git-based extensions, manifest validation, sandboxing, and a unified `peersky://settings` page for managing everything from themes to privacy tools. Pre-installed extensions like uBlock Origin and DScan will be bundled by default.

You can read my full [proposal here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FQU2typchX08ly8lwk7nj8NcARNrTp0GomVICO4b53k/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.nv2vmujhdrj). My mentor for this project is **Akhilesh Thite**.

I'm excited to help build tools that empower users to take control of their browsing experience—and to contribute to the vision of a more decentralized web. Looking forward to the summer ahead!
