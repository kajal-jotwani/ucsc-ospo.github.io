As part of the [WildberryEye](/project/osre25/ucsc/wildberryeye), my [proposal](./GSoC-proposal.pdf) under the mentorship of Isaac Espinosa aims to develop a clean, intuitive, and responsive web-based interface to support real-time pollinator detection, data visualization, and system configuration.

WildberryEye leverages edge computing (Raspberry Pi 5) and object detection (YOLO) to monitor pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. The expectations for this project focuse on developing a full-stack web interface to support real-time pollinator detection, data visualization, and system configuration. The whole development also include the real-time data extraction from the Raspberry Pi 5). The final result empowers researchers and contributors to engage with environmental data in an accessible and meaningful way.
