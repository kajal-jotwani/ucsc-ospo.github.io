Hi! I’m **Devansh Kukreja**, a researcher, indie developer, and Computer Science undergrad. I'm interested in distributed systems, orchestration services, and real-time data platforms. I enjoy working on systems that help different components connect and run smoothly at scale.

This summer, I’m contributing to the [**ENTS**](https://github.com/jlab-sensing/ENTS-backend) (Environmental NeTworked Sensor) platform with the **University of California, Santa Cruz Open Source Program Office** as part of **Google Summer of Code 2025**.

**ENTS** is an open-source web portal designed to collect, visualize, and analyze data from large-scale environmental sensor networks. It helps researchers and citizen scientists monitor sensors like soil moisture, temperature, current, and voltage supporting real-time environmental research in outdoor settings.

My work this summer focuses on improving the platform’s reliability and usability. I’ll be fixing visualization bugs, enhancing chart synchronization, making data point selection more intuitive, and improving error handling. Alongside that, I’m building a **Logger Registration System** that lets users easily add and configure their data loggers, with potential support for over-the-air provisioning via **The Things Network (TTN)** for LoRaWAN-based devices.

You can check out my full [proposal here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CA1ZCTmh0NY0Yu3-ohsmJ3xgSm3ON7by/view?usp=sharing). I’m grateful to be mentored by **Colleen Josephson**, **John Madden**, and **Alec Levy**, who are guiding the project with incredible insight and support.

By the end of the summer, ENTS will be a more stable, user-friendly, and extensible platform—better equipped to support environmental research at scale. I'm super excited to learn, build, and contribute to something meaningful!
