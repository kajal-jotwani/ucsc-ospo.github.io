Hi! I'm Haocheng Xia, a Computer Science student at the **University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign**, passionate about the intersection of **machine learning and storage systems**. Specifically, I'm keen on **workload analysis** and **KV cache management for large language models**.

This summer, I'm happy to be a part of **SoR 2025** and **OSRE 2025**. I'm contributing to the **CacheBench** project. My initiative, **'Building a Benchmarking Suite for Cache Performance Evaluation,'** will create a robust platform. This involves extensive simulation of existing eviction algorithms using [libCacheSim](https://github.com/cacheMon/libCacheSim), developing microbenchmarks, and building a user-friendly platform for researchers to effortlessly evaluate novel cache designs. The ultimate goal is to establish a competitive leaderboard.

My contributions will include a comprehensive dataset detailing simulated **miss ratios** and **throughput** of current cache eviction algorithms, an extension to [libCacheSim](https://github.com/cacheMon/libCacheSim) for executing microbenchmarks both locally and on our online platform, and the creation and ongoing maintenance of a public web leaderboard. I'm grateful to be mentored by **Juncheng Yang** and **Yazhuo Zhang**.

I'm thrilled to be part of building tools that empower users and advance the vision of a more decentralized web. Looking forward to a productive summer!
